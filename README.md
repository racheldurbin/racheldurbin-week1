## Description

I made a webpage describing myself, Rachel Durbin. I explained the projects I did during my first week at Epicodus and even gave the links for them. I included my prior work history so that everyone can see I have no background in coding or developing and that this all brand new to me!

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to desktop
* Open all files in VS Code
* Read the HTML
* Read the CSS
* Images are provided

Although I had some challenges remembering the order to code things in and spent a lot of time going back through our material, I am pretty sure I met most of the requirements. Even if they might be very basic and not too prettied up.

## Known Bugs

* I am hoping that I did this correctly
* and that all my commits were pushed to GitHub

## License
