    <img src="Annabel.jpg" alt="Beloved fur baby, Annabel.">
    <p>I am 29 years old and my favorite thing in the world is my beloved cat, <em>Annabel.</em> I was born and raised in Long Beach, CA. Some things I am passionate about are animal rights and protecting our environment. I like creating things; I have taught myself how to sew, knit, make jewelry, and macrame. I also enjoy listening to podcasts and find learning survival skills fascinating.</p>

    <div class="history">
      <p><h2><strong>Before attending Epicodus...</strong></h2></p>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>I graduated high school in 2010</li>
        <li>My first job was doing data entry for a ground support equiptment company</li>
        <li>I worked as a server and manager at a small family owned Vietnamese restaurant</li>
        <li>In 2013, I began working the front desk at a salon and as soon as I passed my State Board Exam, I was allowed to assist a handful of stylist</li>
        <li>One year later, I became a stylist myself </li>
        <li>I finally decided I wanted to explore options that would allow me to work remotely, at least most of the time. I needed something more stable, considering I am starting a family. <span class="highlight">A friend of mine who attended Epicodus explained to me that I could work for companies whose values I admire and still be creative while working in coding and developement.</span></li>
      </ul>

    <div class="projects">
      <p1>Below are the projects I created during my first week at Epicodus and a brief description of them.</p1>
      <p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/racheldurbin/hello-world.git">Hello-world</a> is a webpage that tells you how to say "hello" in seven different languages. I created this project in the HTML language.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/racheldurbin/my-first-website.git">My-first-website</a> is a webpage listing what I hope to learn while attending Epicodus. This project was created with HTML, but includes an example of adding a README.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/racheldurbin/goodbye.git">Goodbye</a> explains how to say goodbye in English and Spanish. Again, this project was created with HTML language only.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/racheldurbin/cookie-recipe.html.git">Cookie-recipe</a> includes the ingredients and directions on how to make the best chocolate chip cookies ever. This was the last project I only used the HTML language to create. For the first week, the goal was to understand HTML before moving on to other languages.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/racheldurbin/cupcake-shop.git">Cupcake-shop</a> is a webpage I created displaying three different cupcakes. <span class="best">I used the languages HTML and CSS in this project and included three images.</li></span>
