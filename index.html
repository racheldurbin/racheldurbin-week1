    <p><strong>About Me:</strong>
    For the last seven years, I have been working as a hairdresser here in Long Beach, CA. I am 29 years old and my favorite thing in the world is my beloved cat, <em>Annabel.</em></p>

    <p>Below is a list of projects I created during my first week at Epicodus.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>hello-world</li>
      <li>my-first-website</li>
      <li>goodbye</li>
      <li>cookie-recipe</li>
      <li>cupcake-shop</li>
      <li>boring-lecture</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let me tell you a little about each project.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/racheldurbin/hello-world.git">Hello-world</a> is a webpage that tells you how to say "hello" in seven different languages. I created this project in the HTML language.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/racheldurbin/my-first-website.git">My-first-website</a> is a webpage listing what I hope to learn while attending Epicodus. This project was created with HTML, but includes an example of adding a README.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/racheldurbin/goodbye.git">Goodbye</a> explains how to say goodbye in English and Spanish. Again, this project was created with HTML language only.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/racheldurbin/goodbye.git">Cookie-recipe</a> includes the ingredients and directions on how to make the best chocolate chip cookies ever. This was the last project I only used the HTML language to create. For the first week, the goal was to understand HTML before moving on to other languages.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/racheldurbin/cupcake-shop.git">Cupcake-shop</a> is a webpage I created displaying three different cupcakes. I used the languages HTML and CSS in this project and included three images.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/racheldurbin/boring-lecture.git">Boring-lecture</a> is a webpage I created discussing how boring lorem ipsum is to everyone in the universe. This project was also created with HTML and CSS, but only contains one image.</li>
    </ol>
